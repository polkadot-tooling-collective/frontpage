The initial structure shall be as minimalistic as possible, to limit maintenance and social drama. This has the downside of being less resilient against foreign takeovers, but in the beginning, I think it is fine to rather focus on social cohesion.

There is no differentiation between maintainers of "Core Tooling" and "dApp Tooling". They both share the same set of members and rank structure. These terms are only used to clarify the mission goal.

### Rank 0 - Candidate

Developers who want to join can be inducted by any Member into this rank. A vote for promotion to rank 1 can be started not earlier than six months after being inducted.

They are expected to be a maintainer for one of the tools on the mission list.

- Voting weight: 0
- Salary mult: task-based bounties

### Rank 1 - Member

Members are expected to keep up the maintenance of at least one tool from the mission list. This includes extending them and creating new tools that are needed by the Polkadot developer community.

- Voting weight: 1
- Salary mult: 0.1 + task-based bounties

### Further Ranks

The initial member seeding will show how many ranks need to be created to arrive at the correct granularity. The requirement for adding new ranks is that they are *absolutely necessary*.

We do not want to end in a situation where ranks are purely added to show off.

## Salary Structure

There is no initial salary or bonus structure. In the future, after PoToC proves itself worthy, it is proposed to set up a bounty-centered pay structure.

Different tiers of bounties shall be defined, and a fairly low baseline salary will be paid to all members. This is done to provide an incentive for improving the tooling instead of sloth.

A member may apply for a specific bounty while providing evidence of fulfilling the bounty requirements. Granting of a bounty will be decided upon by a 50% on-chain vote. A cap on the monthly bounty payout should be established to prevent runaway spending and prioritize important changes. Bounty votes may only commence once per month to ease coordination between the Members.

The exact constants for the size of the bounties and baseline salary will be proposed through a secondary document in `Phase II`.

## Initial Members

There shall be a seeding repo that allows anyone to apply to a rank. Applications should include a list of tools and contributions that show their past commitment to Polkadot tooling development. The applicant must justify why they are a good fit to join PoToC.

Eventually, there needs to be a social consensus on the initial set of members. This set would then be proposed to the tokenholders, either as part of the PoToC proposal itself or as a separate referendum.

## Future

There are a lot of questions unanswered by this document. In the beginning, we will use the Core Fellowship as a guiding light for processes and ethics as much as possible. Eventually, PoToC would develop its sub-culture (pun intended) and show more of its own identity.

A rough mid-term plan could look like this:

### Phase I - Setup

This phase is for setting everything up and getting it enacted on-cain. It should take at most 6 months.

- 1.1 Contacting all stakeholders: Tokenholders, Seeding members, and The Fellowship.
- 1.2 Pitching the proposal to the community and incorporating feedback. 
- 2.1 Crafting a preliminary implementation to ensure that all important parameters are mentioned in the proposal.
- 2.2 Binding governance vote via Wish-For-Change track. This is treated as the final signal on whether to pursue it or not.
- 3.1 Final implementation and approval by The Fellowship.
- 3.2 Enactment on-chain and beginning of operations.

## Phase II - Probation Period

PoToC starts operating in a risk-reduced mode without governance funding. This phase will be used to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of PoToC.

Hopefully, the general public will deem it useful and approve of its future funding requests.

This phase should take from 6 months to 1 year.

## Phase III - Business As Usual

PoToC enacts its salary structure. The creation and granting of bounties starts and attracts new developer talent.

This will demonstrate that creating a System Collective can be done by anyone, and hopefully inspire the wider community to further its decentralization efforts in that direction.
