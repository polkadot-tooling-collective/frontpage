## The Mission

The Polkadot Tooling Collective acts in the best interest of Polkadot. It tries to have a positive impact on developer success in the Polkadot Ecosystem and intends to do this by working towards two main goals:

- To maintain developer tools to build Polkadot _itself_ (Core Tooling)
- To maintain developer tools to build _on_ Polkadot (dApp Tooling)

Since these definitions are not sufficiently precise, an exhaustive _Mission List_ is provided by PoToC. This _Mission List_ is the only source of truth about its mission.

Similar to the Core Fellowship, one of PoToC's goals is to recognize and retain developers who make substantial contributions to these areas. Specifically, the collective should focus on people who have contributed to the specification or implementation of Polkadot tooling. Having an on-chain body will provide a means for these developers to align and organize.

PoToC may want to apply for treasury funding in the future; it is therefore clear that any infringement upon its mission statement must be treated as an attempt to exfiltrate governance funds.

## Mission List

The _Mission List_ contains all projects and services that are maintained by PoToC.

It is divided into two sections, solely to keep the requirements of each section clearly defined; _Core_ and _dApp_. It can be updated through an on-chain 2/3-majority rank-weighted vote across all Members.

Some obvious cornerstones that must be upheld by all projects are:

- Must be FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software).
- Source code must be accessible without a login requirement.
- All members of PoToC must have permission to propose changes and raise issues.

The _Mission List_ will be defined as part of the initial seeding.

### Core Tooling

Generally, all tools that are used by The Fellowship to craft, test, and validate updates fall into this category. But only the tools that are predominantly developed for this cause shall be maintained by PoToC. For example, the Rust language is not predominantly developed for Polkadot; hence, it does not fit here.

### dApp Tooling

This category contains all tools and libraries that are used to build _on_ Polkadot and are predominantly developed for this cause.
